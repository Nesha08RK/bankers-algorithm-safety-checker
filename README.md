# bankers-algorithm-safety-checker

**A web-based application that implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in operating systems. Users can specify a variable number of resources, input allocation and maximum resource requirements for processes, and check if the system is in a safe state. The tool provides a detailed step-by-step visualization of the algorithm’s execution.**

**Features**





+ Dynamic Resource Count: Specify 2 to 10 resources, with the interface dynamically adapting to the input.



+ Real-Time Need Calculation: Automatically computes the Need matrix (Maximum - Allocation) as users enter values.



* Automatic Safety Check: Determines if the system is in a safe state and generates a safe sequence of processes.



+ Step-by-Step Display: Shows each step of the algorithm, including Work, Need, Allocation, and Safe Sequence.



+ Input Validation: Ensures non-negative inputs and that Allocation does not exceed Maximum.



+ Responsive Design: Clean, modern UI with a gradient background, card layout, and mobile-friendly styling.



+ Reset Functionality: Clears inputs and resets the interface for new simulations.

**Technologies**





HTML: Defines the structure of the web interface.
