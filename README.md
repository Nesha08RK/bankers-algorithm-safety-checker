# bankers-algorithm-safety-checker

A web-based application that implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in operating systems. Users can specify a variable number of resources, input allocation and maximum resource requirements for processes, and check if the system is in a safe state. The tool provides a detailed step-by-step visualization of the algorithmâ€™s execution.

Features





Dynamic Resource Count: Specify 2 to 10 resources, with the interface dynamically adapting to the input.



Real-Time Need Calculation: Automatically computes the Need matrix (Maximum - Allocation) as users enter values.



Automatic Safety Check: Determines if the system is in a safe state and generates a safe sequence of processes.



Step-by-Step Display: Shows each step of the algorithm, including Work, Need, Allocation, and Safe Sequence.



Input Validation: Ensures non-negative inputs and that Allocation does not exceed Maximum.



Responsive Design: Clean, modern UI with a gradient background, card layout, and mobile-friendly styling.



Reset Functionality: Clears inputs and resets the interface for new simulations.

Technologies





HTML: Defines the structure of the web interface.



JavaScript: Implements the Banker's Algorithm, dynamic UI generation, and real-time calculations.



CSS: Provides styling with gradients, shadows, and responsive design.
